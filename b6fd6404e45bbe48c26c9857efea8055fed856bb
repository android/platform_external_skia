      "message": "Thanks! You might still need this (or some version of it), because my plan is to make a change to upstream Skia, which will get merged into the internal Android version of external/skia. That won\u0027t affect AOSP until we open source S, whenever that is. I also have some questions in line:\n\n\u003e Patch Set 1:\n\u003e \n\u003e In answer to the question on that review thread, third_party/libgifcodec/ has a GPL license. You are welcome to split out the single license that the large-scale-change adds into multiple licenses. For example, applying GPL only to the targets built from third_party/libgifcodec/\n\nCurrently, that code is built as part of libskia. If we wanted to separate that out, would that mean we\u0027d need to build a separate library that libskia imports as a shared library?\n\n\u003e \n\u003e Any module or rule type where you might want to override the default_applicable_licenses allows a \u0027licenses \u003d [...],\u0027 property.\n\nI\u0027m not familiar with where the \u0027licenses\u0027 property is allowed. You currently have a default_applicable_licenses property for the whole package. If I wanted to split things up, could it look something like:\n\ncat \u003e Android.bp\n\npackage {\n    default_applicable_licenses: [\"external_skia_license\"],\n}\n\nlicense {\n    name: \"external_skia_license\",\n    visibility: [\":__subpackages__\"],\n    license_kinds: \u003csame as before, minus GPL\u003e\n    license_text: [\"LICENSE\",\"NOTICE\"],\n}\n\ncc_library {\n  name: \"libgifcodec\",\n  licenses: \u003cGPL licenses\u003e # override/replace the default\n  ...\n}\n\ncc_library_static {\n  name: \"libskia\", # mostly as before\n  ...\n  shared_libs: [\n    ...\n    \"libgifcodec\",\n  ]\n  ...\n}",
