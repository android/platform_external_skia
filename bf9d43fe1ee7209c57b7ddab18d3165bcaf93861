The source of truth is a \"test_app\" called \"fuzz\" in BUILD.gn [2].\n\nThe proper way to do this would be to add one or more targets in gn_to_bp.py like we have for dm [3]. You can submit this to upstream skia (instructions start at https://skia.org/user/download). The process that merges upstream into Android\u0027s external/skia will generate Android.bp.\n\n[1] https://source.corp.google.com/android/external/skia/gn/gn_to_bp.py?q\u003dgn%2Fgn_to_bp.py\u0026ct\u003dos\u0026sq\u003dpackage:%5Eandroid$%20-file:external%2Fskqp%20-file:external%2Fqt\n[2] https://source.corp.google.com/android/external/skia/BUILD.gn;l\u003d2195\n[3] https://source.corp.google.com/android/external/skia/gn/gn_to_bp.py;l\u003d248?q\u003dgn%2Fgn_to_bp.py\u0026ct\u003dos\u0026sq\u003dpackage:%5Eandroid$%20-file:external%2Fskqp%20-file:external%2Fqt",
